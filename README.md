<h1>ClassKitPresidents</h1>

This is a demo app created for a presentation I gave at 360iDev 2018, titled:

<h2>ClassKit and Schoolwork</h2>

The video for this talk is available at https://vimeo.com/310848851 (or  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuMb36hTGFk if you prefer).

The app's supposed purpose is to quiz the user on US Presidential Elections from 1804 through 1824.  Used without ClassKit, the app first presents a dialog asking the user to choose one of those elections.  The user is presented with the winner of that election, and asked two questions.

The first question is to choose the loser of that election.  The user is presented with three options.  The first option is always the right choice (I told you this is a demo app!).  The other two choices are chosen at random from the list of losers for the other races in the data set.

The second question asks the user if Massachusetts voted for the winner in this election.

Data was gathered from Wikipedia.  It was simplified in that many Presidential elections have more than two candidates, thus more than one loser.  I chose the loser with the best turnout among the loser, typically the candidate from the opposing major party of the time.

I make no claims to...anything.  I think the app functions as described above, but it might not.  Who knows.  It served its function as an app to demo capabilities of ClassKit as it exists in August, 2018.

The presentation file is in this repo, both as Keynote and PDF files.

I'll guess the best license to use is the MIT License, so that's the license.  Please make use of the sample code to write your ClassKit app, but please test your own app thoroughly.  Feel free to credit me if you use my code (or just find it helpful), but that's not at all necessary.  If you find any glaring errors related to ClassKit feel free to create an issue, send a note, or whatever you'd like.  If you find any errors in the rest of the quiz app it's probably best to keep that to yourself as the quiz isn't much of an example of anything.
